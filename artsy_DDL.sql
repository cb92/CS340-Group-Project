('Post-Impressionism', 'derived from Impressionism with use of vivid colors, thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use arbitrary color'),
('Abstract Art', 'use of a visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world'),
('Cubism', 'subject depiction using multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context; objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint'),
