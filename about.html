					Two of my great passions in life are travel and photography. Through my photography I seek to express my appreciation for the locations and experiences in my life, and capture the impact that makes them meaningful to me. I was raised with a strong affinity for the natural environment, whether it was camping in National Parks, visiting foreign countries, or spending summer (and winter) days outside in the Pacific Northwest. I first became interested in photography as a child when I started experimenting with my parents’ new, 2-megapixel(!) digital camera. Over the following decade I leveraged that interest and a series of high school and college art requirements into a passionate hobby and a passable training in the composition, shooting, and developing that let me share moments as I see them. 
					Whenever possible I travel with my girlfriend/adventure partner Christina and my camera gear to escape routine and experience some of the the beautiful, remote, or challenging locations in the world. Our shared interests in camping, hiking, SCUBA, and getting gross and sweaty summiting a pass to see the sights less seen have allowed us to visit some truly incredible places, and through photography I try to both capture the essence of the experience and fortify the memory of the time spent there. While I’m not travelling I work as a robotics engineer, explore with new recipes and ingredients in the kitchen, and spend time planning the next trip before I’m done organizing my photos from the last one (or two).
